    <h1>Experience</h1>

    <h2>Minimap</h2>

    <p>
        I'm currently a mobile and web developer at Minimap, a location based
        social media network that aims to connect people based on mutual events
        of interest. I implemented the website for Minimap using React.js (with
        the styled-components library) based on our design. Through this
        experience, I'm gaining real-world experience with developing websites
        and applications for commericial use.

        RiceDiscuss
        <i>(in-progress)</i>
    </h2>

    <p>
        I'm currently one of two team leads of the RiceDiscuss project within
        riceapps. RiceDiscuss aims to be a Hacker News/Reddit crossover to
        encourage student discussion of topics of interest at Rice. RiceDiscuss
        employs a React.js frontend as well as an Apollo GraphQL and MongoDB
        backend. Through this project, I am learning full-stack development as
        well as the skills necessary to run a team of multiple developers, UI/UX
        designers, and product managers in an Agile workflow.

    <h2>
        Rice University International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) 2019
    </h2>

    <p>
        Our 2019 iGEM project focused on increasing drought resistance in
        <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
        by engineering rhizobacteria (specifically
        <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>
        ). To make translation of rhizobacterial enzymes thermodependent, we
        required custom-designed low temperature RNA thermometers. I wrote a
        Python program (and accompanying GUI) which implemented a genetic
        algorithm utilizing
        <a href="https://github.com/deap/deap">
            Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python
        </a>
        (DEAP) and
        <a href="http://www.nupack.org/">NuPack</a>
        to produce low temperature RNA thermometers.
