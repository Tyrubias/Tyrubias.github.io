            About Me
        </h1>

        <p>
            I'm a sophomore at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics as well as Biochemistry and Cell Biology. I am currently in search of full-stack development, data science, and systems engineering internships. I
            have experience with Java, R, Python, and ReactJS as well as basic biological laboratory techniques. I aim
            to use unconventional techniques to create innovative tools which benefit the social good and solve outstanding problems.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I am currently the treasurer and a team lead at riceapps, an application development organization at Rice University that builds software for community partners. You can find our work and contact us at <a href="http://www.riceapps.org/">riceapps.org</a>.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            In my free time, I enjoy dancing (both k-pop and hip-hop choreographies!), reading, and experimenting with cool tech. I'm a member of BASYK, a dance club at Rice University. You can find our YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGDQyIZpxF4mv8ZUDif5ohg">here</a>.
