            I'm a rising junior at Rice University looking for full-stack development, data science, and systems
            engineering internships. I enjoy working in fast-paced team environments with a continuous learning mindset
            and rigorous team feedback. I aim to use interdisciplinary thinking to create innovative tools which benefit
            the social good and solve outstanding problems.

            <br />
            <br />

            In April 2020, I became a mobile and web developer at <a href="https://minimap.us/">Minimap</a>, a
            location-based social media network that aims to connect people based on events of mutual interest. I'm also
            doing research analyzing data on wearable devices as part of the <a href="https://pathsup.org/">PATHS-UP</a>
            (Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations) REU (research experience for
            undergraduates) at Rice University.

            <br />
            <br />

            Between April 2019 and April 2020, I was the treasurer and a team lead at riceapps, an application
            development organization at Rice
            University that builds software for community partners. You can find our work and contact us at <a
                href="http://www.riceapps.org/">riceapps.org</a>.

            <br />
            <br />

            In my free time, I enjoy dancing (both k-pop and hip-hop choreographies!), reading, and experimenting with
            cool tech. I'm the team manager for BASYK, a dance club at Rice University. You can find our YouTube channel
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGDQyIZpxF4mv8ZUDif5ohg">here</a>.
