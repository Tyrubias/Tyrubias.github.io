            Radar
        </h2>

        <p>
            I'm currently a mobile and web developer at Radar, a location based social media network that aims to
            connect people based on mutual events of interest. I implemented the website for Radar using React.js (with
            the styled-components library) based
            on our design. Through this experience, I'm gaining real-world experience with developing websites and
            applications for commericial use.

        <h2>
            RiceDiscuss <i>(in-progress)</i>
        </h2>

        <p>
            I'm currently one of two team leads of the RiceDiscuss project within riceapps. RiceDiscuss aims to be a
            Hacker News/Reddit crossover to encourage student discussion of topics of interest at Rice. RiceDiscuss
            employs a React.js frontend as well as an Apollo GraphQL and MongoDB backend. Through this project, I am
            learning full-stack development as well as the skills necessary to run a team of multiple developers, UI/UX
            designers, and product managers in an Agile workflow.

        <h2>
            Rice University International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) 2019
        </h2>

        <p>
            Our 2019 iGEM project focused on increasing drought resistance in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by engineering
            rhizobacteria (specifically <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>). To make translation of rhizobacterial enzymes
            thermodependent, we required custom-designed low temperature RNA thermometers. I wrote a Python program (and
            accompanying GUI) which implemented a genetic algorithm utilizing <a
                href="https://github.com/deap/deap">Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python</a> (DEAP) and <a
                href="http://www.nupack.org/">NuPack</a> to produce low temperature RNA thermometers.
